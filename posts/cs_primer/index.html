<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As I reflect on my current state as a Computer Science major with three semesters left before I finish my Undergraduate program, I realize that not being aware of certain resources to support me and taking advantage of a few resources sooner, put me behind in pursuing Software Development.</p>
<p>In this post, I am attaching a link to resources that I felt helped me or I know can help others in their tech journey. I created the list of resources in a Notion page. The resources have a tag(s), summary, and link to the resource or member signup (if applicable). I will highlight a few but I encourage everyone to look through all of them.</p>
<h3 id="codepath">CodePath</h3>
<p>Codepath is an organization that offers free courses to undergraduates in App Development (Android/IOS), Cybersecurity, and Technical Interview Preparation. For the App Development and Cybersecurity courses, Codepath partners with schools. Alumni from these courses have landed jobs in several Fortune 500 companies. The career fair that they host in the fall has included Verizon, Dropbox, and Dreamworks Animation.</p>
<p>Last year, I applied for the Technical Interview Prep course (Intermediate Track), I didn&rsquo;t get into the live classes. Though, I did get into the observer track. The observer track allowed me to access the course portal and connect with others in the track via Slack. Even though, I didn&rsquo;t finish the course in its entirety, I was impressed with the quality of the content. I highly reccomend aspiring software engineers to take this course!</p>
<h3 id="colorstack">Colorstack</h3>
<p>Colorstack is an organization for Black, Hispanic/Latnix, and Native Americans currently in degrees in computing. The mission is to increase retention and success of minorities in tech.</p>
<p>Colorstack is the most active slack group I&rsquo;ve been apart of. By active, I mean members are posting on the channels regularly. I&rsquo;ve only been a member for about two months but I already see that this is truly a family.</p>
<h3 id="design-buddies">Design Buddies</h3>
<p>Design Buddies is discord group. The founder, Grace Ling created the group around May 2020, as she was still in the process of making the switch from engineering to design. She wanted to a create a community of designers of all skills to collaborate and learn from each other.</p>
<p>Being part of this community during Summer 2020 was great! I was able to learn more about UX design and the abundant amount of resources for learning UX.</p>
<h3 id="medium">Medium</h3>
<p>Medium is a platform for people to write and post articles on various topics.</p>
<p>I like the site because I can follow topics like Programming and UX as well as organizations and people. I get emails about articles from topics and people I follow. You can also search for a topic (i.e UX case study) and get results. My only downside is that Medium limits the amount of articles you can read for free. I wish there was a free plan for students because I currently can not afford five dollars a month subscription.</p>
<h3 id="quora">Quora</h3>
<p>Quora is a community that&rsquo;s similar to Yahoo Answers, where you can ask random questions like &ldquo;What surprised you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quora has been helpful for me in finding resources to help learn programming along with learning about life. I will warn you that sometimes some weird stuff can pop up on your feed.</p>
<h3 id="rewriting-the-code">Rewriting the Code</h3>
<p>Rewriting the Code is a community open to all current college women interested in careers in technology and engineering. There are monthly opportunities to attend personal and professional development webinars designed to help you succeed in technology and meet company partners for potential jobs and internships.</p>
<p>Rewriting the Code has been one of the most influential organizations I&rsquo;ve been apart of as a CS major. I&rsquo;ve learned about so many opportunties through there and everyone is so helpful.</p>
<h3 id="tech-together">Tech Together</h3>
<p>Tech Together is an organization that hosts beginner friendly, female hackathons and workshops throughout the year. You can subscribe to the newsletter to get emails about resources and upcoming workshops.</p>
<p>I learned about this organization by reaching out to Alejandra Molina, the co-founder of Beepboop, a platform to learn Spanish through daily speaking drills.
I found Beepboop compelling so I reached out to her for a meeting. During our talk, she expressed interest in learning more about me. When I told her, I was a CS major she mentioned I should reach out the her friend who is one of the co-founders of Tech Together.
I haven&rsquo;t attended the workshops or any of the hackathons but I find the information contained in their newsletter beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p>I hope my post got you excited in checking out these resources and I wish you good luck in your journey!</p>
