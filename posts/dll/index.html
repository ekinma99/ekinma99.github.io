        <h2 id="an-overview-of-digital-learners-to-leaders">An Overview of Digital Learners to Leaders</h2>
<p>In 2019, I participated in a program at my school called Digital Learners to Leaders. Digital Learners to Leaders, at the time, it was a school year long program with the purpose increasing digital literacy among students. Students are organized in teams with an assigned student leader. Each team, through the course of the program, has a problem that they want to solve using technology. We would have about 10 official meetings which were called sprints. Within these sprints, professionals from around Atlanta would give talks to participants in hopes that the information aids in creating the technical solutions. Some of the talks included Graphic Design, User Experience, App Development, Virtual/Augmented Reality, and Public Speaking/Presentation skills.</p>
<h2 id="my-teams-solution-to-food-waste">My Team&rsquo;s Solution to Food Waste</h2>
<p>For Digital Learners to Leaders, my team worked on an app aiming to minimize food waste in the Georgia State University community.  The app was called “The Pantry”. In the app, the user would take pictures of leftovers. Afterwards, using AI/Machine Learning, the app would identify the food. Next, the person could either use the app to find a recipe with the ingredients or post the items for other students to take if interested. Additionally, if it was a nonperishable item, it could be donated to a local charity.</p>

<h2 id="presentations-and-working-on-the-pantry">Presentations and Working on The Pantry</h2>
<p>Since this was a school year long program, we had a presentation for each semester. For the fall semester, we were in the prototyping phase. In the spring, we were expected to have the final product. For the fall semester presentation, I helped work on the presentation and prototype. I did research on statistics on food waste in the United States. We used Figma for the prototype.  For creating the actual app, I researched software that we could use to create the app. The work that I took upon myself were tasks that I felt needed to be done and my other teammates were not doing.</p>
<h2 id="my-overall-experience">My Overall Experience</h2>
<p>The experience was amazing and not so amazing at the same time. It was through the experience I learned about User Experience, VR/AR, organizations such as Civic Center for Innovation and Creative Juice and React Native. My team dynamic was not great. I had a leader that did not care for this program. I had teammates who dropped out. Whenever I would present an idea or try to get my team members to focus at our meetings, I was often ignored. We did not come up with an app at the end of the program, nor did we present for the final presentation because we failed to come up with at least an app in working progress. I wish we had more mentoring. I wish I wasn&rsquo;t so distracted and maybe the idea of creating a web app instead of a native app would have came to me sooner. I wish I persevered to make some progress in the app development. Later on, I could find others who would want to work with me. Digital Learners to Leaders was truly an experience that I will carry on with me through the rest of my days.</p>
